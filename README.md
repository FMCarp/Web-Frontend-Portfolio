# Web frontend Portfolio

Some of my webpages projects. <br />
They were mainly designed as a dashboard for various online sensors and IoT connected devices.
They were deployed on AWS EC2 servers or on single board computers (e.g. Raspberry-Pi).

Some web interfaces are hosted by IoT devices themselves to allow for easy setup and configuration.
